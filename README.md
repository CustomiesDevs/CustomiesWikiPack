# CustomiesWikiPack

This is an example resource pack implementation for the examples shown in the [Customies Wiki](https://github.com/CustomiesDevs/Customies/wiki).

> Customies is just a plugin which provides an API for developers to register custom features. Developers are expected to create the resource pack themselves, and should use resources like [wiki.bedrock.dev](https://wiki.bedrock.dev) for guides on creating them. For support with the Customies API, you can [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/Tm6wGxWqgh).
